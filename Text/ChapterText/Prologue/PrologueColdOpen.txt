[OQ]Rumors of increase in cult[N]
sympathy in the Yraklan fens-[CQ][AN]
Rumors, then. Nothing to act on.[AN]
Still[Beat] next I see the Duke I'd[N]
best counsel greater patrols.[AN]
Oh, but, hm, the Duke's mired[N]

[OQ]Jurispotence Alexigant du Partriz,[AN]
Our sweep of the port unveiled no less[N]
than four crews complicit in the[N]
smuggling of spirit dust from[N]
outside the Liovian border.[AN]
Under interrogation, one gave up[N]
the location of an abandoned[N]
warehouse the glassblowers set[N]
up shop within.[AN]
We led a raid only to find it[N]
cleaned and evacuated no more[N]
than forty-eight hours before[N]
our arrival.[AN]
But given the scale of their[N]
operation and our crackdown of[N]
the port, they are not like to[N]
set up again in the near future.[AN]
With Your Honor's consent, I would[N]
take the men and expand the[N]
investigation deeper into the[N]
Yraklan heartland.[AN]
Remind the citizenry of their[N]
God-given duty to report illegal[N]

write this letter back telling[N]
her to petition her local court,[AN]
and shred this waste of[N]
parchment from Foreman Ulhiri.[AN]
[ML]Your will be done, Your Honor.[AN]
Now, the ink will take time[N]
